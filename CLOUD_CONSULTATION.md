## Limitations

### General Legal Advice
- Provides general legal information, not specific legal advice
- Should not replace consultation with qualified legal professionals
- May not reflect the most current legal developments
- Jurisdiction-specific laws may vary

### Model Limitations
- Training data cutoff dates may affect currency
- May not include recent legal developments
- Should be verified against authoritative sources
- Not a substitute for legal research

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Provider not available"**
- Check API key in `.env` file
- Verify API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- Ensure internet connection is stable

**"Generation failed"**
- Check API rate limits
- Verify model name is correct
- Try reducing max tokens or temperature

**"Cost estimation failed"**
- This is a non-critical feature
- Consultation will still work without cost estimates
- Check provider-specific pricing documentation

### Performance Optimization

**For faster responses:**
- Use lower max tokens (500-1000)
- Select faster models (gpt-4o-mini, gemini-1.5-flash)
- Use concise analysis style

**For better quality:**
- Use higher max tokens (2000-4000)
- Select more capable models (gpt-4o, claude-3-5-sonnet)
- Use comprehensive analysis style

## Integration with SC Gen 5

The Cloud Consultation feature is designed to complement the existing RAG system:

- **Cloud Consultation**: General legal advice without document context
- **Legal Research (RAG)**: Document-specific analysis with your uploaded files
- **Companies House**: UK company research and filings
- **Document Manager**: File upload and processing

This provides a complete legal research platform with multiple consultation options.

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
python3 test_cloud_consultation.py
```

The test script will:
- Check available providers
- Test consultation with different providers
- Verify advanced settings
- Test error handling

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in environment variables
- No sensitive data is logged
- Session data is stored locally in browser
- Cost estimates are approximate and for guidance only

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-language support**: Legal consultation in different languages
- **Citation tracking**: Automatic legal citation generation
- **Case law integration**: Direct access to case databases
- **Document comparison**: Compare AI analysis with uploaded documents
- **Collaborative sessions**: Share consultations with team members
